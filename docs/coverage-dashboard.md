# Coverage dashboard

Generated from **1,262,588** post-2000 published match rows and **148,639** main-tour feature rows. Coverage counts are row availability, not proof that every real-world event is present.

The machine-readable marginal breakdown is [`coverage_dimensions.csv`](../data/curated/post_2000/coverage_dimensions.csv); the complete report and definitions are in [`coverage_report.json`](../data/curated/post_2000/coverage_report.json). Each row reports population size, field-present rows, missing rows, and percent present for the selected dimension.

## Timing and known gaps

- Exact match start timestamps and local time zones are not present in the result source.
- Odds rows have opening and provider-reported last pre-match prices for two players where available, but not verified individual quote timestamps or a quote time zone.
- Result-publication timestamps are not present. Tournament dates and assumed delays are not substituted for them.
- A missing ranking, score, duration, or statistic remains missing. The dashboard counts its absence explicitly.
- Qualifiers, Challenger main draws, Futures/ITF main draws, WTA ITF rows, and tour main draws are measured in separate population categories where source fields permit classification.
